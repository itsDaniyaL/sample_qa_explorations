# sample_qa_explorations
I have added QA exploration for the following sites in this repository. These test steps are written in a sequential flow, also for the granular level understanding I have added the important fields in the template such as outline, setup pre-requisites, steps and expected outcomes etc. 
- Spotify
- SoundCloud

`Note: Since the test steps are written and templated in the excel format for better readability hence cannot be viewed in GitHub so I have added the following sample images as well, though there are more tabs with more TCs in the files too.  `
